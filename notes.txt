Notes for javaGeom library

JavaGeom is a Java library for geometrical computations.
It provides a general framework for manipulating and creating geometric primitives,
computing the intersection points between shapes, transforming the shapes by affine
transforms, and performing measurements.

Classical uses are the creation of geometrical primitives by the user, their modification,
and measurements or tests of some predicates.
